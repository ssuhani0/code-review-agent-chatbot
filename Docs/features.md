# ✨ Features

This document provides a detailed overview of the **capabilities and functionalities** of the AI Code Review Agent.

Each feature is designed to mirror **real-world developer tooling** used in modern software teams.

---

## 🔍 Automated Code Review

- Submit source code via API or UI
- Receive instant, structured feedback
- Eliminates the need for manual first-pass reviews

**Output includes:**
- Bugs & logical errors
- Security vulnerabilities
- Code quality improvements
- Performance suggestions

---

## 🧠 LLM-Powered Code Analysis

The system uses **code-specialized Large Language Models (LLMs)** running locally via **Ollama**.

### Key Advantages
- Deep understanding of syntax and semantics
- Context-aware reasoning
- Human-like explanations
- No external API calls

**Default Model:**
- `deepseek-coder:6.7b`

---

## 🧪 Static Analysis Integration

Before invoking the LLM, the system runs **rule-based static analysis tools**.

### Tools Used
- **pylint** → coding standards & style issues
- **bandit** → security vulnerabilities
- **radon** → cyclomatic complexity

### Why This Matters
- Reduces LLM hallucinations
- Improves accuracy and trust
- Provides objective signals to the AI

---

## 🌐 Multi-Language Ready Design

The architecture is built to support **multiple programming languages**.

### Current Support
- Python (full support)

### Planned Languages
- JavaScript
- Java
- C / C++
- Go
- TypeScript

Language detection is handled automatically using:
- File extensions
- Syntax heuristics

---

## 📂 File & Folder Analysis

- Upload single files or entire project folders
- Automatically iterates through source files
- Skips irrelevant files (configs, binaries)

This enables **realistic project-level reviews**.

---

## 🧩 Context Chunking for Large Codebases

Large files exceed LLM context limits. This system solves that by:

- Splitting code into logical chunks
- Preserving context and structure
- Aggregating results into a unified report

This allows analysis of **enterprise-scale code**.

---

## 📊 Structured Review Output

Instead of plain text, the system returns **structured JSON output**.

### Review Sections
- Bugs & logical errors
- Security issues
- Code quality recommendations
- Performance improvements
- Suggested refactored code

This format is ideal for:
- Frontend dashboards
- CI/CD pipelines
- Automated reporting

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Offline Execution

- Runs completely **offline**
- Code never leaves the local machine
- Safe for proprietary or confidential code

This makes it suitable for **enterprise and internal tooling**.

---

## ⚡ Fast & Lightweight Backend

- Built using **Flask**
- Minimal overhead
- Easy to extend and deploy

Ideal for:
- Hackathons
- Internal tools
- Developer utilities

---

## 🧩 Extensible & Modular Design

Each component is isolated and replaceable:

- Swap LLM models easily
- Add new static analyzers
- Extend language support
- Integrate with CI/CD pipelines

---

## 🛣️ Upcoming Features

- GitHub Pull Request review bot
- Diff-based code review
- Code quality scoring
- Web-based dashboard
- CI/CD pipeline integration

---

## ⭐ Summary

The AI Code Review Agent is not just a demo—it is a **production-inspired system** designed for scalability, accuracy, and real-world usability.
